# Competitive_Programming

As you know hacktoberfest is back this year again! 

Hacktoberfest is an annual month-long celebration of open source organised every year by DIgital Ocean. Every participant who follows their set of rules and get 4 Pull Requests (PRs) merged will receive swags. 

This repo will include all types of code algo which will be helpful for CP.

## Note:
Don't simply copy from net and paste. What you have to do is explain the concept with examples and write code in a markdown file. If you have taken reference from any website or video mention it in bottom and also mention your name and university at the bottom.

Also, any idea is welcome.


## Happy CodingðŸ¥³
